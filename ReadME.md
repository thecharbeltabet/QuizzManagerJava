Charbel Tabet's Quizz Manager
===========================

This is a simple quiz manager that allows you to create quizzes and manage them.
It is made as a requirement for java programming course at EPITA

Comments:
----------
First I think that we needed to start the project in class because the requirements are not clear
I didn't know if it is allowed to change the data model or to add something.
Moreover, we are on vacation so time didn't allow me to do it in the way I inteded to do
Therefore I am presenting the project in a way that is not the best. 

Running the project:
---------------------
Some BL is missing so the program is not fully functional.
However the tests , the data model and the DAOs are working.
